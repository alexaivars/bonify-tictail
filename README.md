## Building with Grunt

Start by installing grunt and a few required tasks:
```console
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
```

Then, start watching for file changes using these commands:
```console
grunt watch
```

To build and optimize with a single command, call grunt with no arguments.
```console
grunt
```
